# My Corne keyboard configuration

## Rationale:

In my search for a custom layout that suited my needs, I experimented with home row mods. However, the combination of the steep learning curve and the strange sensation caused by variable latency when tapping the home row keys never quite worked for me. 
One of my attempts to avoid writing capital letters involved placing the Shift key on a thumb key. This helped me realize that I’m less sensitive to latency when it comes to spaces or deleting characters, compared to when I’m typing letters. As a result, I shifted my focus to thumb key mods.
The layout I use now is tailored specifically to my workflow, and others may not find it immediately usable. However, if you’re reading this, you’re likely already an enthusiast of workflow optimization and customization, so I encourage you to modify it as needed to fit your own preferences.

My day-to-day work revolves around a specific set of applications, so I’ve customized my layout to optimize my workflow with them. Here are the apps I use daily:
* Neovim: My primary editor for experimenting and handling certain work-related tasks. I’ve built muscle memory around the hjkl keys for navigation, but otherwise, most commands are mnemonic-based for me.
* JetBrains IDEs: This is what my team primarily uses, and I mainly work on the Unreal codebase here. I use IdeaVim to keep my workflow consistent with my Neovim configuration.
* Visual Studio Professional 2022: I use this occasionally, primarily for debugging. I used to write a lot of code here, but nowadays, I mostly rely on Visual Studio’s debugging shortcuts like F10, F11, and F12.
* Unreal Engine Editor: I use it for auditing data and testing the tools I'm developing.
* Terminals and shell: zsh and powershell on Windows terminal and wezterm on other operating systems. Note that I use the buitin multiplexer of Wezterm. 
* 3D DCC Apps (Blender, Houdini): While I don’t create content myself, I perform basic commands and navigate through content in these apps.
* Perforce (p4v): Although I still use the command line, especially on Linux, I always have a p4v instance running to browse changes and review changelists from teammates.
* Microsoft Teams: I spend a significant amount of time here, responding to colleagues, copying and pasting information, and sharing screenshots I capture on the fly of bugs or issues.

Operating system wise, I actually switch quite often contexts, my work machine is a Windows machine, I also use MacOS for work to target iOS and MacOS. And my personal machine runs on Arch. My home lab consists of a bunch of Linux machines, running either Debian or Ubuntu.

I quite often use the mouse on the right hand while using shortcuts with my left hand, these shortcut often involve the Ctrl modifier so it was important to keep if on the left hand.

Known issues: 
* Space + Capital letter on nvim.
* Ctrl + shft + click.
